# Beyond theory-driven models: evaluation of preceding factors affecting Bangladeshi online shoppers purchase intention

## Overview
This project explores key factors influencing consumer behavior in the rapidly growing e-commerce sector of Bangladesh. By integrating the **Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)** with machine learning techniques and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, we aim to identify the attitudes, social norms, and perceived behavioral control that significantly affect online purchase decisions. 

The dataset used in this study was collected through a survey targeting Bangladeshi consumers, focusing on their online shopping behaviors. This project also includes an **ablation study** to evaluate the impact of various behavioral factors on different predictive models. 
  


## Dataset
The dataset consists of survey data from **352 participants**, predominantly university students in Bangladesh, collected from March 2024 to May 2024. It includes the following variables:
- **Attitude** (ATTD)
- **Social Norm** (SN)
- **Perceived Behavioral Control** (PBC)
- **Purchase Behavior** (PB)
